# Artifacts Audio — Canonical Ledger

> **This repository is the authoritative public record for Artifacts Audio.**

## Purpose

This ledger serves as the single source of truth for:

- **Documentation** — How Artifacts work, from concept to implementation
- **Lore** — The philosophy, history, and narrative behind Artifacts
- **Artifact Registry** — Canonical catalog of all published Artifacts
- **Release Manifests** — Cryptographically signed release records
- **Integrity Policies** — Rules governing authenticity, scarcity, and evolution

## Principles

1. **Transparency** — Everything that can be public, is public
2. **Immutability** — History is append-only; we never rewrite the past
3. **Verifiability** — Claims are backed by cryptographic proof
4. **Precedence** — This ledger predates and governs all tooling
