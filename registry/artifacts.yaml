    notes: |
      The Genesis Artifact is a singular creation — one of one, never to be repeated.
      It exists as proof that the system works and as the anchor point for all
      Artifacts that follow.
      
      Genesis will be released when the infrastructure is fully operational.
      Its release will be announced in this ledger.
