# Lore

This section contains the stories, mythology, and cultural context of the Artifacts ecosystem.

## Why Lore Matters

Artifacts are not just software. They are objects with history, provenance, and meaning. The lore gives them weight.

A plugin you downloaded is a tool. An Artifact with a story is a possession.

## Contributing to the Lore

The lore is not fixed. It grows with the community.

Some lore is **canonical** — established facts that define the universe. Canon is controlled and versioned.

Some lore is **apocryphal** — community stories and interpretations. Apocryphal lore may become canon if it resonates.

To propose additions to the lore:

1. Submit a pull request to the `artifacts-ledger` repository
2. Mark your contribution as `[APOCRYPHAL]` or `[PROPOSED CANON]`
3. Community discussion determines if it advances

## The Role of Combust

The [Combust mechanism](../concepts/combust.md) is central to Artifact lore. When an Artifact combusts, it transforms — not just functionally, but narratively.

Each evolution stage has its own character:

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| **Spark** | Potential. Unproven. Full of possibility. |
| **Ember** | Warming. Finding its voice. |
| **Flame** | Confident. Established. |
| **Blaze** | Powerful. Demanding respect. |
| **Inferno** | Final form. Legendary. Permanent. |

The stories we tell about Artifacts reflect these stages.

## On Collecting

To collect Artifacts is to collect moments in time.

Each Artifact was created at a specific point, evolved through specific decisions, and carries the fingerprints of those who shaped it. The blockchain of provenance is not just cryptographic — it is human.

When you acquire an Artifact, you join its story. When you combust it, you write the next chapter.

This is not metaphor. This is design.
