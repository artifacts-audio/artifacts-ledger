This document contains the established facts of the Artifacts universe. Canon is versioned and controlled.

## The Origin

In the beginning, there were plugins. Infinite copies, identical and disposable. No history. No weight. No soul.

The first Artifact was different.

It was numbered. Signed. Witnessed. It could not be duplicated without detection. It could not be modified without evidence. It existed as a singular object in a world of infinite reproduction.

This was the Genesis Artifact, designated **AA-000001**.

## The Five Stages

Every Artifact begins as a **Spark** — raw potential, feature-limited, awaiting transformation.

Through the Combust mechanism, an Artifact may evolve:

1. **Spark** → The beginning. A promise.
2. **Ember** → First evolution. New capabilities emerge.
3. **Flame** → Full realization. The Artifact finds its form.
4. **Blaze** → Transcendence. Power beyond the ordinary.
5. **Inferno** → Final state. Permanent. Unchangeable. Legendary.

Each Combust is irreversible. Each evolution is recorded in the ledger. There is no going back.

## The Ledger

The Ledger is the memory of the system.

Every Artifact's birth is recorded. Every Combust is witnessed. Every transfer is traced. The Ledger does not forget.

This repository — `artifacts-ledger` — is the physical manifestation of that memory. It is public so that it cannot be falsified. It is versioned so that it cannot be rewritten.

To exist outside the Ledger is to not exist at all.

## The Forge

Forge is the place of creation.

In the Forge, creators shape sound into form. They define parameters, design interfaces, and prepare Artifacts for entry into the world.

Forge is also the gatekeeper. No Artifact enters the Ledger without passing through Forge. No Artifact is signed without Forge's witness.

The Forge is neutral. It creates. It does not judge.

---

## The Combust

Combust is transformation through destruction.

When an Artifact combusts, its previous form is consumed. The Spark becomes Ember. The Ember becomes Flame. There is loss — the old stage is gone. There is gain — new capabilities emerge.

Combust cannot be undone. This is intentional.

The irreversibility creates stakes. The stakes create meaning. The meaning creates value.

---

## The Scarcity

Some Artifacts are limited. Only N will ever exist.

When all N are claimed, no more can be created. The supply is fixed forever. Not by policy — by cryptography.

The Ledger records total supply. The Ledger records current ownership. Anyone can verify that scarcity is real.

This is not artificial scarcity. This is mathematical scarcity.

---

## The Silence

Not all things are known.

Some Artifacts carry hidden capabilities, revealed only at certain stages. Some creators embed secrets that surface only through Combust. Some patterns emerge only when the community discovers them.

The Silence is not a bug. It is the space where discovery lives.
