# Field Notes

Observations, experiments, and discoveries from the edges of the Artifacts ecosystem.

Field notes are informal. They capture thinking-in-progress, anomalies, and community discoveries. Some may become canon. Most will remain here as historical record.

## Note #001: On the Nature of Digital Objects

*January 2025*

We speak of "digital scarcity" as if it were a contradiction. Bits can be copied infinitely, we say. Scarcity is artificial.

But consider: a cryptographic signature cannot be forged. A hash cannot be faked. A ledger entry, once written and witnessed, cannot be erased.

The scarcity of an Artifact is not in the bits themselves — it is in the *witnessed state* of those bits. Anyone can copy the file. No one can copy the provenance.

This is the insight that makes Artifacts possible.

## Note #002: Why Five Stages?

*January 2025*

The five-stage Combust system was not arbitrary. Early designs considered three stages, seven stages, continuous evolution.

Five emerged from practical constraints:

- Fewer than five felt too limited — not enough room for meaningful progression
- More than five created decision paralysis — when to combust?
- Five maps well to human intuition: beginning, early, middle, late, end

The names (Spark, Ember, Flame, Blaze, Inferno) follow a fire metaphor. Fire transforms. Fire cannot be reversed. Fire is both creative and destructive.

Other metaphors were considered (growth stages, alchemical transmutation, astronomical progression). Fire won because it captures the irreversibility most viscerally.

## Note #003: The Collector's Dilemma

*January 2025*

An Artifact at Spark stage has maximum potential but minimum capability.

An Artifact at Inferno stage has maximum capability but no further potential.

Which is more valuable?

This is the collector's dilemma. There is no correct answer — only preference.

Some collect Sparks, preserving potential like seeds in a vault.

Some race to Inferno, seeking maximum power.

Some hold at Flame, balanced between potential and realization.

The market will eventually price these preferences. For now, they remain personal.

## Note #004: Observed Combust Patterns

*Pending observations*

As Artifacts enter circulation and users begin to Combust, patterns may emerge:

- Do most users Combust immediately or wait?
- At what stage do users tend to stop?
- Do certain Artifact types see different patterns?

This section will be updated with real data as the ecosystem matures.

## Note #005: On Forgery and Fakery

*January 2025*

Someone will try to fake an Artifact. This is certain.

They will copy the files, attempt to forge signatures, create convincing-looking bundles. They may even succeed in fooling some users temporarily.

They will not succeed in fooling the Ledger.

The Ledger is public. The verification process is documented. Any user can check any Artifact against the canonical record. A fake cannot survive contact with the Ledger.

This is why the Ledger must remain public, immutable, and accessible. It is the immune system of the ecosystem.
