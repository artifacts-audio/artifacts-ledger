# Core Concepts

Understanding Artifacts requires a shift in thinking about what audio software can be.

## Philosophy

Traditional plugins are **tools**. You buy them, you use them, you forget about them. They are infinitely copyable, endlessly pirated, and fundamentally disposable.

Artifacts are **objects**. They have provenance. They have history. They have scarcity. They can evolve — and that evolution is permanent.
