# What is an Artifact?

An **Artifact** is a self-contained audio plugin that carries its own identity, provenance, and evolutionary history.

## Definition

Unlike traditional plugins that are anonymous copies of a binary, each Artifact instance is:

1. **Individually Signed** — Every Artifact has a unique cryptographic signature
2. **Provenance-Tracked** — Origin, ownership history, and transformations are recorded
3. **Self-Verifying** — Can prove its authenticity without phoning home
4. **Evolution-Capable** — Can transform through the Combust mechanism

## The Key Insight

An Artifact is **not** a plugin with DRM.

It is a plugin that *knows who it is* — and can prove it.

This identity enables everything else: scarcity, evolution, trading, collecting. Without identity, these properties are impossible to enforce.
