# The Combust Mechanism

**Combust** is the irreversible transformation system that gives Artifacts their evolutionary character.

## The Five Stages

- **Stage 0: Mint** — The original state
- **Stages 1-4: Evolution** — Each stage transforms the Artifact
- **Stage 5: Final Form** — The ultimate evolution, no further Combustion possible

## Design Philosophy

Irreversibility creates:

- **Weight** — Decisions matter
- **Diversity** — Different owners make different choices  
- **Narrative** — Each Artifact has a unique journey
