# Scarcity & Evolution

Two properties that seem impossible for digital goods — made real through cryptographic design.

## Digital Scarcity Without Blockchain

Anyone can copy an Artifact file. But:

- The copy will not have valid signatures
- The copy will not be recognized by Frame (the runtime)
- The copy will not be tradeable on Market
- The copy will not have provenance

The original remains scarce because **identity cannot be copied** — only the shell can.

## Edition Sizes

When an Artifact is created, its edition size is fixed and cannot be changed after minting.

## Evolution

Artifacts can transform over time through the **Combust** mechanism. Each transformation:

- Changes the Artifact's capabilities or appearance
- Is **irreversible** — you cannot go back
- Is **recorded** — the history is permanent
- Is **intentional** — requires owner action
