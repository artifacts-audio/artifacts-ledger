# Artifacts Audio

Welcome to the canonical ledger for Artifacts Audio.

This repository serves as the permanent public record for all Artifacts: their documentation, provenance, release history, and the principles that govern their creation and distribution.

## What This Ledger Contains

**Concepts** — The foundational ideas behind Artifacts: what they are, how they evolve, and why scarcity matters in digital instruments.

**Manual** — Practical documentation for installing, authorizing, updating, and troubleshooting Artifacts and the Forge application.

**Registry** — The official catalog of all Artifacts ever created, with links to their manifests, checksums, and canonical pages.

**Releases** — Signed release history for all published Artifacts and tooling, with verification instructions.

**Lore** — The stories, field notes, and canon that give Artifacts their cultural weight.

**Policies** — The integrity, transparency, and governance rules that bind this project.

## Why a Public Ledger?

Artifacts are collectible audio plugins with cryptographic integrity and genuine digital scarcity. For scarcity to be meaningful, it must be verifiable. For verification to be trustworthy, the records must be public.

This ledger exists so that anyone can:

- Verify that an Artifact is authentic
- Confirm its evolution stage and lineage
- Audit the release history
- Understand the rules that govern the system

No claim made by Artifacts Audio about an Artifact's authenticity, rarity, or provenance is valid unless it can be verified against this ledger.

## Integrity Guarantee

Every release published by Artifacts Audio is:

1. **Signed** with a cryptographic key whose public half is published here
2. **Checksummed** with SHA-256 hashes recorded in this repository
3. **Tagged** in Git with a verifiable release commit

If you cannot verify a release against this ledger, treat it as untrusted.
