# Artifacts Audio

> **Digital audio plugins as collectible, evolving objects.**

Welcome to the canonical documentation for Artifacts Audio — a new paradigm for audio software where plugins are not just tools, they are *artifacts* with identity, history, and genuine scarcity.

## What Makes Artifacts Different?

Traditional plugins are infinitely copyable. Artifacts are not.

Each Artifact is:

- **Unique** — Cryptographically signed with verifiable provenance
- **Scarce** — Limited editions that cannot be counterfeited
- **Evolving** — Can transform irreversibly through the Combust mechanism
- **Collectible** — Tradeable objects with real ownership

## The Ecosystem

- **Forge** — Desktop application for creating and packaging Artifacts
- **Frame** — Runtime player that loads and runs Artifacts in your DAW
- **Market** — Platform for trading and collecting Artifacts
- **Ledger** — This canonical record of truth (you are here)
