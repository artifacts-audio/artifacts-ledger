# Authorization

Artifacts use a license-based authorization system tied to your Artifacts Audio account.

## How Licensing Works

When you acquire an Artifact, you receive an **entitlement** recorded in our licensing system. This entitlement grants you the right to:

- Install the Artifact on your machines
- Use it in your projects
- Transfer it (where permitted by the Artifact's terms)

Entitlements are tied to your account, not to a specific machine. You can use your Artifacts on any computer where you are signed in to Forge.

## Signing In

1. Open Forge
2. Click **Account → Sign In**
3. Enter your Artifacts Audio credentials
4. Forge will sync your entitlements automatically

If you don't have an account, you can create one at [artifacts.audio/account](https://artifacts.audio/account).

## Offline Authorization

Artifacts require periodic online verification, but can operate offline for extended periods.

When you sign in with an internet connection, Forge caches your entitlements locally. This cache is valid for **30 days**. After 30 days without connectivity, Forge will prompt you to reconnect.

For fully offline environments, contact support for offline license options.

## Machine Limits

By default, each Artifact entitlement can be active on **3 machines** simultaneously. This covers typical setups:

- Studio desktop
- Laptop
- Secondary workstation

If you need additional activations, you can deactivate a machine from your account dashboard or request an increase.

## Transfers

Some Artifacts are **transferable**, meaning you can permanently transfer your entitlement to another user. Transfer rules vary by Artifact:

- **Transferable**: Can be sold or gifted to another user
- **Non-transferable**: Bound to your account permanently
- **Limited transfers**: Can be transferred a fixed number of times

The transfer status of each Artifact is recorded in the [Registry](../registry/index.md).

To initiate a transfer:

1. Go to your account dashboard
2. Select the Artifact
3. Click **Transfer**
4. Enter the recipient's Artifacts Audio email
5. Confirm the transfer

!!! warning "Transfers Are Permanent"
    Once transferred, an Artifact cannot be reclaimed. The recipient becomes the sole owner.

## Verification

You can verify your authorization status at any time:

1. In Forge, go to **Account → Licenses**
2. Each Artifact shows its status: **Active**, **Expired**, or **Pending**

If an Artifact shows as unauthorized but you believe you own it, try:

1. Signing out and back in
2. Clicking **Account → Refresh Licenses**
3. Contacting support if the issue persists
