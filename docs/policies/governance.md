# Governance

This document defines how decisions are made about the Artifacts ecosystem.

## Current Governance Model

Artifacts Audio is currently governed by its founding team. This is a **benevolent dictatorship** model appropriate for early-stage projects.

As the ecosystem matures, governance may evolve toward more distributed models. Any such transition will be documented here with advance notice.

## Decision Categories

### Technical Decisions

Decisions about code, architecture, and implementation:

- Made by the development team
- Documented in commit history and release notes
- Open to community input via GitHub issues

### Policy Decisions

Decisions about rules, terms, and boundaries:

- Made by the founding team
- Documented in this ledger
- Major changes announced with 30-day notice

### Registry Decisions

Decisions about what enters the registry:

- Made by Artifacts Audio (currently)
- Subject to documented criteria
- Appealable via formal process (coming)

### Economic Decisions

Decisions about pricing, supply, and markets:

- Made by the founding team
- Subject to announced policies
- Cannot retroactively change existing Artifact terms

## Immutability Principles

Certain things cannot be changed after the fact:

| Immutable | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Artifact ID assignments | Prevents confusion and fraud |
| Past Combust events | The ledger is append-only |
| Total supply of limited Artifacts | Scarcity must be credible |
| Published checksums | Verification must be stable |
| This ledger's Git history | Audit trail must be preserved |

These immutability guarantees are enforced technically where possible and by policy where not.

## Change Process

### Minor Changes

Small updates, clarifications, typo fixes:

- Committed directly
- No advance notice required
- Recorded in Git history

### Standard Changes

New features, policy updates, registry additions:

- Announced in release notes
- Documented in this ledger
- Effective upon publication

### Major Changes

Breaking changes, policy reversals, governance evolution:

- Announced 30 days in advance
- Open for community comment
- Final decision documented with rationale

### Emergency Changes

Security issues, critical bugs, legal requirements:

- May be immediate
- Documented as soon as safely possible
- Post-mortem published

## Community Input

We welcome community input through:

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, feature requests, and technical discussion
- **Pull Requests**: For documentation and (eventually) code contributions
- **Email**: [feedback@artifacts.audio](mailto:feedback@artifacts.audio) for private feedback
- **Forums**: [artifacts.audio/community](https://artifacts.audio/community) for general discussion

Community input is considered but not binding. We explain our reasoning when we decline suggestions.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a dispute with Artifacts Audio:

1. **Informal Resolution**: Contact us directly at [support@artifacts.audio](mailto:support@artifacts.audio)
2. **Formal Complaint**: Email [complaints@artifacts.audio](mailto:complaints@artifacts.audio) with details
3. **Escalation**: If unresolved, see our Terms of Service for arbitration procedures

We aim to resolve disputes fairly and transparently.

## Future Governance

As the ecosystem grows, we may transition to:

- **Advisory Board**: Community representatives with input on major decisions
- **Token-based Governance**: Voting rights tied to Artifact ownership
- **Foundation Model**: Independent non-profit stewardship

Any transition will be:

- Announced well in advance
- Documented in this ledger
- Designed to protect existing rights

For now, trust is personal. We aim to earn and keep it.
