# Integrity Policy

The rules governing authenticity, verification, and trust in the Artifacts ecosystem.

## Core Principles

1. **Cryptographic Proof Over Trust** — We give you tools to verify, not promises to trust
2. **Transparency by Default** — Everything that can be public, is public
3. **Immutable History** — We never rewrite the past
4. **Offline-First Verification** — The internet is optional for verification

*Integrity is not a feature. It is the foundation.*
